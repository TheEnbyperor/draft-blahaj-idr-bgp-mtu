1.  Introduction

   To help achieve the highest possible MTU end-to-end, this document
   extends BGP-4 to aid network operators in this effort by signalling
   the MTU for each route.

   A new BGP capability declaring the link MTU is specified in
   Section 4.

   An optional, non-transitive attribute, called "Path MTU", is
   specified in Section 5.  It allows network administrators to use Path
   MTU in their route selection.  The main focus/applicability is the
   Internet (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast route advertisements).

   The BGP attribute defined in this document can be attached to
   prefixes from Multiprotocol BGP IPv4/IPv6 Labeled Unicast
   ([RFC4760]).  Usage of this BGP attribute for other Address Family
   Identifier (AFI) / Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI)
   combinations is not defined herein but may be specified in future
   specifications.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP14]
   (RFC2119,RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terms "MTU" in this document signifies the Maximum Transmission
   Unit for a given BGP address family.

2.  Assumptions

   All MTU values are measured in bytes at layer 3.

   Each BGP speaker is configured with the following values:

   *  Link MTU: Maximum packet size the BGP speaker can process through
      its own ASN

   *  Fallback MTU: Maximum packet size if no per-route information is
      supplied (usually 1500 bytes)

   It is also assumed that the FIB used by the BGP speaker supports per-
   destination MTU values, such as is the case for the Linux kernel.

3.  Theory of Operation

   A BGP speaker advertises the link MTU capability as follows:

   *  The link MTU capability is announced only if a BGP speaker
      understands the Path MTU route attribute

   *  The link MTU capability is set to the configured local Link MTU,
      as defined above

   When establishing a session with a peer, a BGP speaker does the
   following:

   *  If the peer advertises the link MTU capability, compute the
      effective link MTU as the minimum of the locally configured link
      MTU and the link MTU advertised by the peer

   *  If the peer link MTU is different from the local link MTU, an
      implementation SHOULD emit a warning

   When announcing a route:

   *  If the session does not have an effective link MTU, then this part
      is ignored.

   *  Otherwise, if the route already has a path MTU attribute

      -  If the effective link MTU is smaller than the value in the
         attribute, update the path MTU value in the attribute to the
         value of the effective link MTU

      -  Leave the origin ASN in the attribute as-is

   *  If the route does not already have a path MTU attribute, add a new
      attribute with

      -  The MTU value set to the effective link MTU

      -  The ASN set to the local ASN

   When installing a route into the FIB:

   *  If the route has no path MTU attribute, install the route with the
      fallback MTU.

   *  If the ASN appearing in the path MTU attribute is different from
      the originating ASN from the AS path, ignore the attribute and
      install the route with the fallback MTU.

   *  Otherwise, compute the route MTU as the minimum of the effective
      link MTU and the value in the path MTU attribute, and install the
      route with this route MTU.

4.  Link MTU Capability

   A new BGP capability with ID XXX is defined with the following
   contents:

   0                   1
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |fl.|          Link MTU         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Flags  2 bits; flags are reserved for future use and MUST be 0.

   Link MTU  14 bits; The BGP speakers MTU for the link a BGP session is
      being negotiated over.

5.  Path MTU Attribute

   A new optional, non-transitive BGP attribute with ID XXX is defined
   with the following contents:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Origin ASN                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |fl.|          Path MTU         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Origin ASN  32 bits; the first ASN along the path to support this
      attribute.

   Flags  2 bits; flags are reserved for future use and MUST be 0.

   Link MTU  14 bits; The MTU for a route.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Capability

   Per this document, IANA is requested to add one new entry to the
   "Capability Codes" registry defined in [RFC5492].  This entry is
   defined below:

                  +=======+=============+===============+

   Path Attributes" registry defined in [RFC4271].  This entry is
   defined below:
