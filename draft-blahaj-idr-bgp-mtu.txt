1.  Introduction

   To help achieve the highest possible MTU end-to-end, this document
   extends BGP-4 to aid network operators in this effort by signalling
   the MTU for each route.

   A new BGP capability declaring the link MTU is specified in
   Section 2.

   An optional, non-transitive attribute, called "Path MTU", is
   specified in Section 3.  It allows network administrators to use Path
   MTU in their route selection.  The main focus/applicability is the
   Internet (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast route advertisements).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP14] (RFC2119,
   RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.
